# FreeCamera üé•.

Addon for [Godot](https://godotengine.org) that adds a class `FreeCamera`. `FreeCamera` is a camera that can be moved freely with the W, A, S and D keys and rotated with the mouse. In the demo I also use my [Godot](https://godotengine.org) addon [Stars](https://github.com/divin/Stars), feel free to check it out.
